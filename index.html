            A firecracker is a small explosive device primarily designed to produce
            a large amount of noise, especially in the form of a loud bang, usually
            for celebration or entertainment; any visual effect is incidental to
            this goal. They have fuses, and are wrapped in a heavy paper casing to
            contain the explosive compound. Firecrackers, along with fireworks,
            originated in China.
